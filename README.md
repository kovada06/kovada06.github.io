<p>Worked on the graphical user interface and back-end of the EDURange refactor under Richard Weiss and Jack Cook. EDURange is an application that controls the creation of multiple specifically defined virtual machines that are meant to provide realistic exercises for students in computer science, primarily security and networking students. The application includes a GUI in the form of a website that allows instructors to more easily control the scenarios and various virtual machines while managing the students engaged in the exercise.</p>
<p>Continuing to work extensively with Wesley Deneke (advisor), Henry Baker, and David Jenson on a simulation platform/framework that is capable of generating automatically varied simulations involving multiple human agents. These agents are capable of performing interactions with static objects as well as human agents; that is, human-object interactions as well as human-human interactions in the form of collaborative activities. The default scenario is a classroom environment, but the platform is built in a way that is easily extensible to other domains and activity sets with minimal to no hard-coded changes. Previous group members include: Andrew Evans, Amy Sonnenberg, Nick Stanton, Tyler Bateman, Phile Steinke, and Manu Atwal</p>
